--------------Advance------------------
What is class?
template or blue print 
contains values etc.

What is object?
instance of class.

Encapsulation 
Data Hiding -- restricting access to any member of an object 
Data binding -- data members and the methods together as a whole.

Polymorphism
eg: shapes: circle square triangle rhombus

What is compile time polymorphism and how it is different from runtime polymorphism?
				Types of Polymorphism
Compile Time					  Run time
(Static or						(Dynamic or
Early binding)					 Late Binding)

Compiler decides 				Cant be decided 
								by compiler, dependes on execution

do not consume any memory. When objects are created they actually initialize the class member and methods and consume memory.

What is contructor?
name same as class name.
Myclass myclass = new Myclass();

What is copy constructor?
copy object to another. 
clone an object and its values, into another object.
